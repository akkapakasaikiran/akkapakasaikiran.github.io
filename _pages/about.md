Hi, I am Saikiran, a Computer Science MSc student at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch). I am currently doing my master's thesis at [Disney Research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com), working on diffusion models for video generation.

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://iitb.ac.in) in 2022. In my bachelor's thesis, I worked with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on self-supervised multimodal learning. 

I've had the pleasure of interning at 
- [Egonym AG](https://egonym.com), working on anonymizing faces using diffusion models
- [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), working on classifying Bing ads
- [Abacus.ai](https://abacus.ai), working on explainable recommender systems
- [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) with Prof. [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel), working on formal methods

I am passionate about carnatic music and [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/116391594). I also like [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/skeleton-detective), [writing](https://asaikiran.medium.com), and playing table tennis.
