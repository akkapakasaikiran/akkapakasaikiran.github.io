Hi, I am Saikiran, a Computer Science MSc student at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch). 
My focus is on Visual Computing and Machine Learning, and I am currently doing my master's thesis at [Disney Research Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com), working on rendering and generative AI.

I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://iitb.ac.in) in 2022.
In my bachelor's thesis, I worked with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) and Prof. [Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) on self-supervised multimodal learning. 

I've had the pleasure of working at the following places: 
- [Egonym AG](https://egonym.com), working on anonymizing faces using diffusion models
- [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), working on classifying Bing ads
- [Abacus.ai](https://abacus.ai), working on explainable recommender systems
- [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) with Prof. [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel), working on formal methods


I am currently looking for full-time Machine Learning opportunities! I am excited by the myriad applications in computer vision and graphics opened up by advances in machine learning and AI. Feel free to check out my [resume](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf) and drop me an email if you want to chat! 

I love being outdoors, especially [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/116391594). I also pursue carnatic music and enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/skeleton-detective). I occasionally [write](https://asaikiran.medium.com), usually about my bike adventures.
